This way, the output error is used to directly update the weights of the hidden layers instead of propagating the error backwards.\n","\n","*Note*: \n","The following network is a direct copy of the notebook \"neural network from scratch\"  in this repository, where the minimal change required to replace backpropagation with Direct Feedback Aligment was done."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab_type":"code","id":"kDKBsH37j0L6","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34},"outputId":"6d2319d5-1dd4-4d9d-f2ef-fef57f36fe45"},"source":["import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import numpy as np\n","\n","#for logistic sigmoid function (a.ka. expit)\n","from scipy.special import expit\n","\n","# import of sigmoid and crossentropy\n","from scipy.special import expit\n","from sklearn.metrics import log_loss\n","\n","\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import numpy as np\n","from keras.datasets import mnist\n","from keras.utils.np_utils import to_categorical\n","np.random.seed(1234)\n","%matplotlib inline\n","import sys"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Using TensorFlow backend.\n"],"name":"stderr"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"hMKhoL9jkEme"},"source":["## Iris Dataset\n","This example will use the popular \"iris\" dataset.\n","\n","The [Iris dataset](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html) was [originally introduced](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) by Sir Robert Fisher in 1936 as an example for discriminant analysis.\n","The data focus on how to discriminate between three different types of the [iris flower](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(plant) ):\n","\n","* Setosa, \n","* Versicolour and\n","* Virginica\n","\n","Each row in the dataset contains the following features (measured in cm):\n","\n","* Sepal Length, \n","* Sepal Width, \n","* Petal Length and \n","* Petal Width.\n","\n","The labels (true values) are mapped as integers in $[0,1,2]$ for the three different flower types.
