In some scenarios, a simple number is sufficient, e.g. \"How many pieces of cake are there?\" - and you might answer \"6 (pieces of cake)\".\n","\n","However, in many situations a simple number is not sufficient, e.g. \"How far is it to your home\". Just answering \"3\" is not sufficient, we now need a _unit_, e.g. km: \"My house is 3 km from here. These numbers are called denominate numbers or **scalars**. Other examples are temperature, energy, etc.\n","\n","In other situations, more information is required than denominate numbers, e.g. answering the question \"How do I get to your house?\" In addition to a number, a direction is needed: \"Walk 3 km due north\". These numbers are **vectors**, other examples are velocity, momentum, ...\n","Vectors are often represented by their components: $\\vec{v} = a * \\vec{i} + b * \\vec{j} + c *\\vec{k}$, where $\\vec{i}, \\vec{j}, \\vec{k}$ are the unit vectors (for example, in x,y,z direction in Eucledian space) and a,b,c are scalars denoting how far one has to go in each direction.\n","\n","### Vectors\n","Vectors can be combined into new objects:\n","* Sum: $\\vec{W} = \\vec{U} + \\vec{V}$\n","The sum (or difference) of two vectors results in a new vector\n","* Inner Product: $\\vec{U} + \\vec{V} = \\eta$\n","The inner prduct results in a scalar, the inner product of a vector with itself is the square of its magnitude (length)\n","* Cross Product: $\\vec{S} = \\vec{U} \\times \\vec{V}$\n","Two vectors in 3-dimensional space can be combined into a new vector, where the resulting vector $\\vec{S}$ is perpendicular to the plane spanned by $\\vec{U}$ and $\\vec{V}$ and its direction is given by the right-hand-rule.\n","* Multiplied by scalar: A vector can be multiplied by a scalar to change its magnitude.\n","\n","### Tensors\n","If we start from a unit vector and want to change its properties, we have few options so far:\n","* multiply with a scalar to change its magnitude\n","* cross product with another (unit) vector to change its direction.\n","However, this limits us to right angles - if we want to change both magnitude and direction of a vector, we need something else: **tensors** \n","\n","__Terminology__\n","\n","* Scalar: Tensor of rank 0 (magnitude only - 1 component)\n","* Vector: Tensor of rank 1 (magnitude and 1 direction - 3 components)\n","* Dyad:   Tensor of rank 2 (magnigude and 2 directions - $3^2 = 9$ components)\n","* Triad:  Tensor of rank 3 (magnitude and 3 directions - $3^3 = 27$ components)\n","\n","__Dyad Product__\n","\n","A dyad can be constructed from two vectors by taking the product of the components term-by-term of each individual components and then adding them element-wise. The dyad product of two vectors $\\vec{U}$ and $\\vec{V}$ is then simply $\\underline{UV} = \\vec{U} \\vec{V}$, which is neither a dot nor a cross product.\n","If $\\vec{U}= u_1 \\vec{i} + u_2 \\vec{j} + u_3 \\vec{k}$ and $\\vec{V}= v_1 \\vec{i} + v_2 \\vec{j} + v_3 \\vec{k}$, the dyad product is given by $\\underline{UV} = u_1v_1 \\underline{ii} + u_1v_2 \\underline{ij} + u_1v_3\\underline{ik} + \\cdots$. Here, $\\vec{i}$, $\\vec{j}$, $\\vec{k}$ are unit vectors and $\\underline{ii}$, $\\underline{ij}$, etc are unit dyads.\n","Setting $\\mu_{11} = u_1v_1$, $\\mu_{12} = u_1v_2$, the dyad product can be written as $\\underline{UV} =  \\mu_{11} \\underline{ii} +\\mu_{12} \\underline{ij} + \\mu_{13}\\underline{ik} + \\cdots$. The scalar components $\\mu_{ij}$ can be expressed as a matrix:\n","$$\n","\\begin{array}{ccc}\n","\\mu_{11} & \\mu_{12} & \\mu_{12} \\\\\n","\\mu_{21} & \\mu_{22} & \\mu_{22} \\\\\n","\\mu_{31} & \\mu_{32} & \\mu_{32} \n","\\end{array}\n","$$\n","Note that the dyad product is generally not commutative, i.e., $\\underline{UV}\\ne\\underline{VU}$.\n","\n","__Calculating with Tensors__\n","\n","Calculating with dyads is similar to matrix operations, the rules are generally not commutative, i.e., the order matters.\n","\n","Multiplying with a scalar is defined as $a(\\underline{UV}) = (\\underline{UV})a$, i.e. pre- and post-multiplication give the same result\n","\n","The inner product of a dyad $\\underline{UV}$ with another vector $\\vec{S}$ is defined as $\\vec{S}\\cdot (\\underline{UV})$ when we pre-multiply and $(\\underline{UV}) \\cdot \\vec{S}$ when we post-multiply.\n","The order makes a difference: When we pre-multiply: $\\vec{S} \\cdot \\underline{UV} = (\\vec{S} \\cdot \\vec{U})\\vec{V} = \\sigma \\vec{V}$, i.e. the result is a vector with magnitude $\\sigma = \\vec{S} \\cdot \\vec(U)$ and direction of $\\vec{V}$. For post-multiplication, $\\underline{UV}\\cdot\\vec{S} = \\vec{U}(\\vec{V}\\cdot \\vec{S}) = \\lambda \\vec{U}$, i.e. a vector with magnitude $\\lambda = \\vec{V}\\cdot\\vec{S}$ in direction of $\\vec{U}$."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab_type":"code","id":"Wg-T4dIvNPVB","colab":{},"outputId":"4faf3fbd-e3ed-4db8-c8b9-9f0bb8c73f20"},"source":["# import required libraries\n","import numpy as np\n","import tensorflow as tf\n","print(tf.__version__)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["2.1.0\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"ukXio25qNPVG"},"source":["## Example: Scalars\n","\n","Let's start with some simple examples. \n","We define two scalar variables as constants, multiply them and print the result.\n","\n","In Python we would simply write:\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab_type":"code","id":"7F0eebmJNPVH","colab":{},"outputId":"f83a0e2d-75a6-4b43-e513-873ef019a36a"},"source":["a = 5.0\n","b = 6.0\n","c = a*b\n","print(c)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["30.0\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"S5c0uKfANPVL"},"source":["Now we use the TensorFlow equivalents:"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab_type":"code","id":"jPOqDIFhNPVM","colab":{},"outputId":"bb65d34a-e521-416b-dc8b-dd208f2491f5"},"source":["a = tf.constant(5.0)\n","b = tf.constant(6.0)\n","c = a * b\n","print(c)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["tf.Tensor(30.0, shape=(), dtype=float32)\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"lYEF8yz5NPVO"},"source":["We notice that instead the expected printout of ```30``` we obtain a ```tf.Tensor``` object.\n","Its value is indeed ```30``` and the (inferred) type is a 32-bit floating point number.
